# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm - Demonstration and Evaluation

This repository contains a demonstration of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification tasks. The implementation focuses on selecting the optimal number of neighbors (`K`), the importance of feature scaling, and evaluating model performance with various metrics.

## Key Concepts:
- **Choosing the Right 'K':**
   - Too low a value may cause overfitting, while too high a value may result in underfitting.
   - Cross-Validation is used to determine the best 'K' for optimal results.

- **Distance Metrics:**
   - Euclidean distance is the default, but other metrics like Manhattan or Minkowski distances are also considered depending on the dataset.

- **Feature Scaling:**
   - Since KNN relies on distance measurements, itâ€™s essential to normalize or standardize the features to improve accuracy.

- **Dimensionality Reduction:**
   - To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are applied to reduce the number of features and improve performance.

## Evaluation:
The model's performance is evaluated using the following metrics:
   - **Accuracy**
   - **Confusion Matrix**
   - **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score** for a detailed performance breakdown.

## Repository Contents:
- **Jupyter Notebook** containing the KNN algorithm demonstration.
- **Code** for feature scaling, cross-validation, and evaluation of the model.
- **Plots** visualizing the accuracy for different values of 'K' and other metrics.

Feel free to explore the code, run the examples, or contribute to the repository!
